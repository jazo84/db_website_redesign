3	Check Please! Restaurant.com’s Picking Up The Tab!	New Jersey consumers were treated to the best table in the house this week in a big win against online gift certificate seller, Restaurant.com.  On July 9, 2013, the New Jersey Supreme Court handed down a long awaited decision in Shelton v. Restaurant.com (Case No. A-123-10).  The Restaurant.com class action included claims under New Jersey’s Truth In Consumer Contract Warranty and Notice Act (“TCCWNA”) relating to online discounter Restaurant.com’s practice of including a one-year expiration date on its gift certificates and failing to identify which provisions of its certificates are or are not applicable in New Jersey.\n\nTCCWNA is one of New Jersey’s most powerful consumer protection statutes.  In simple terms, TCCWNA provides for statutory liability where a seller uses provisions that violate any New Jersey or Federal law.  The Shelton plaintiffs alleged that Restaurant.com’s gift certificates violated New Jersey’s Gift Card Act by including an impermissible expiration date.\n\nThe Restaurant.com case did not survive its run in Federal Court, but the Third Circuit – in a rare move – certified a handful of TCCWNA-specific questions to the New Jersey Supreme Court.  The result was this week’s favorable decision.  The unanimous Court held that the gift certificates sold by Restaurant.com are consumer contracts subject to TCCWNA and that, despite the fact that the certificates are purchased online, they must still be considered “written” contracts under TCCWNA.\n\nThe Restautrant.com case still has a long road to travel, but the Supreme Court’s favorable interpretation of TCCWNA is great news for consumers.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Restaurant.com case, or if you’ve had problems with gift card and/or gift certificate terms and conditions, please contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

4	Tropicana’s OJ Ads Leave Court With A Bad Taste	Is Tropicana’s advertising full of pulp?  A Federal Court in New Jersey wants to find out.  On June 12, 2013, the Court partially denied Tropicana’s motion to dismiss claims brought against the juice giant alleging that it falsely advertisies its orange juice as all natural.   The plaintiffs in Lynch v. Tropicana Products Inc. (Case No. 11-cv-07382), assert that Tropicana’s “100% Pure” orange juice is in actuality heavily processed and flavored.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that Tropicana’s orange juice is “pasteurized, de-aerated, stripped of flavor and aroma, stored for long periods of time before available to the public, and colored and flavored before being packaged.”  The class action includes claims against Tropicana for unjust enrichment, breach of express warranty, numerous violations of New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin laws, punitive damages, injunctive relief and declaratory relief.  Many of these claims were dismissed by the recent Order, but several have survived, including fraud claims made under New Jersey law where the premium paid by consumers for a “100% pure” product was found to be a sufficient predicate for the claim.\n\nIf you’d like more information about the Tropicana case, or if you’ve been mislead by false or exaggerated advertising claims made in relation to food products, please feel free to contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

11	Are You Sirius??	Ever wonder how SiriusXM pays Howard Stern’s enormous salary?  It’s probably not just by charging bogus fees, but SiriusXM Radio Inc. has been named in a class action suit and has been accused of illegally charging hundreds of thousands of subscribers a $2 administrative fee in violation of their subscription agreements.  In the lawsuit, which was filed in State Court in New York, subscribers allege that although the SiriusXM subscription agreement allows for a $2 invoice administration fee to listeners who pay with a check or money order, Sirius has been improperly charging the same fee to fans who paid by credit card, debit card or by prepaid Sirius or XM subscription charge.\n\nThe suit alleges that Sirius was well aware of this improper charge and yet it neither informed its subscribers of the nature of the charge nor offered a refund of the administration fees in cases where listeners showed that they had paid by means other than check or money order.\n\nThis is the second time Sirius has been sued over these fees by these same consumers.  Their first case, filed in November 2009, was dismissed a year later over the question of whether New York law could be applied to a nationwide class of consumers.  The plaintiffs’ newest iteration of the complaint points out that the terms and conditions of the SiriusXM subscription agreement provide that “all disputes would be resolved in state and federal courts in New York” under the laws of the state and the FCC.    The revised SiriusXM invoice fee class action was filed on February 6, 2013 and is captioned Kaufman v. Sirius XM Radio Inc., Index No. 650420/2013.  Plaintiffs will seek to certify two classes: all current and former New York SiriusXM subscribers and all current and former subscribers in other states who were improperly charged an invoice administration fee.\n\nIf you’d like to stay updated on the SiriusXM fee class action, or if you think you’ve been subjected to improper fees, please feel free to contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

2	You’ve Been Served, Mortgage Servicer!	New Jersey homeowners warmed up this month with a tremendous win in a class action against infamous mortgage servicer, Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc.  A State Court Judge in New Jersey denied Saxon’s motion to dismiss and will allow class claims to proceed against the now-banned-from-the-business servicer.\n\nThe claims in Neglia v. Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc., Docket No. CPM-L-220-13, stem from, among other things, Saxon’s alleged practice of fraudulently inducing homeowners into entering Trial Payment Plans and failing to provide permanent modifications after the homeowner successfully completes the trial period.  When discussing Saxon’s conduct, the Court observed that Saxon used Trial Payment Plans to “set the hook” in struggling homeowners.  The Court denied Saxon’s motion in its entirety and will allow claims for breach of Trial Payment Plan contracts, fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act all to move ahead.\n\nIf you’d like more information on the Saxon case, or if you have mortgage servicing grievances against Saxon, please contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

13	Chase Caught Chasing Fake Debts	Apparently, paying off your debt to JP Morgan Chase the first time isn’t quite good enough for Chase and its debt collectors.  True to Chase’s TV jingle, they’ll “keep on keeping on” even after you’ve paid.  In fact, a class action suit has been filed against Chase alleging it colluded with debt collection agencies and law firms to force consumers into paying off credit card debts they didn’t actually owe in violation of the FDCPA, FCRA, and RICO.\n\nThe lawsuit, captioned as Sierra v. JP Morgan Chase & Co. et al., Case No. 13-cv-656 and filed in Federal Court in the Southern District of New York, alleges that defendants Chase, debt collector NCO Group Inc. (a subsidiary of Chase) and law firm Bickerstaff Heath Delgado & Acosta LLP “engaged in a long-running and pernicious criminal enterprise that uses deceptive and unfair debt collection practices to force consumers to pay ‘debts’ they do not owe.”  The defendants allegedly collaborated to abuse the legal system by seeking judgments for bogus “debts” that were larger than consumers actually owed, were already paid, or were simply fake to begin with.  Through this scheme, Chase and the defendants unlawfully obtained hundreds of millions of dollars from innocent consumers, according to the complaint.  If certified, the class will include all consumers against whom any or all of the defendants collected or attempted to collect a “debt” that was not valid, as well as a subclass that contractually paid off their debt at the request of a defendant and were later injured when a defendant continued to collect on false debt obligations.\n\nIf you’d like more information about this lawsuit, or if you think you have been the victim of unlawful debt collection practices, please contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

7	Milk Money	A sweet settlement was just approved in a class action claiming that the amount of sugar content in Horizon Organic Milk and Silk Soy Milk was misrepresented to consumers.  The plaintiff in Singer v. WWF Operating Company (Federal Court, Southern District of Florida, Case No. 1:13-CV-21232) alleged that certain products were falsely or misleadingly labeled and marketed because they list “evaporated cane juice” rather than “sugar” as an ingredient.  The products bearing the allegedly false labeling, which include Silk Soymilk, Silk Coconutmilk, or Horizon Organic milk, yogurt or Tuberz products, were sold between 2005 and 2013.\n\nWWF denies any wrongdoing but has agreed to settle the class action and resolve the claims.  You are a class member of the Silk/Horizon Organic Milk settlement if, from January 1, 2005 to April 19, 2013, you purchased WWF products that listed evaporated cane juice as an ingredient.  Under the class action settlement, class members with valid proof of purchase will receive reimbursement for 75% of the purchase price, subject to a cap of $50 per household. Those without proof of purchase can still receive a refund of 25% of the purchase price of up to 5 products.\n\nIf you’d like more information about the Silk/Horizon Organic Milk settlement, or if you’ve been mislead by the use of false labeling terms such as “evaporated cane juice” on a food product, please contact the attorneys at DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

14	Is Nationwide Really On Your Side?	A consumer data breach class action was filed against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. relating to an October 3, 2012 cyber-attack that exposed the personal information of nearly one million consumers who requested insurance quotes from the company.  The action, Hancox et al. v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., Case No. 13-cv-02047, was filed in Federal Court in Kansas and    alleges that Nationwide failed to follow basic security protocols and allowed hackers to easily access consumers’ names and Social Security numbers. Hackers were also able to obtain consumers’ genders, occupations and the names and addresses of their employers.\n\nThe Complaint alleges that Nationwide “flagrantly disregarded plaintiff’s and the other Class Members’ privacy and property rights by intentionally, willfully and recklessly failing to take the necessary precautions required to safeguard and protect plaintiff’s and the other class members’ [personally identifiable information] from unauthorized disclosure.”  Compounding the problem, Nationwide did not inform affected consumers about the data breach until six weeks after it occurred.  The Complaint asserts that consumers who had their sensitive data exposed are about 9.5 times more likely to suffer identity fraud. They are also at risk of having their information sold to companies carrying out targeted marketing campaigns.\n\nThe Nationwide data breach class action was brought on behalf of all persons who sought an insurance quote from Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company or Allied Insurance Company and had their personal information compromised by the October 3, 2012 data breach.  If you have been a victim of a data breach or have had your personal information wrongly exposed by a company, please contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC for more information.

10	Smile! Crest Owes You Four Bucks!	Consumers in the Crest Sensitivity toothpaste false advertising class action finally have something to smile about.  A Federal Judge has granted preliminary approval to a class wide settlement between Proctor & Gamble Co. and customers who allege the company falsely advertised the benefits of its Crest Sensitivity Treatment & Protection toothpaste.  Consumers who purchased the product stand to get a $4 refund out of the deal.\n\nThe suit was filed in 2011 by a New Jersey consumer who claimed that the toothpaste failed to deliver relief from tooth sensitivity “within minutes” as advertised by Proctor & Gamble, and that the false advertising induced consumers into paying as much as 75% more for Crest Sensitivity Treatment & Protection over comparable products that require weeks of use to reduce tooth sensitivity.  Plaintiff also alleged that Crest Sensitivity Treatment & Protection is essentially identical to Crest Pro-Health toothpaste except for the packaging, color and, of course, the price (which is $3 higher for the Sensitivity version).  Proctor & Gamble denies the allegations but has agreed to the settlement to resolve the litigation.  The case is pending in Federal Court in New Jersey and is captioned as Rossi v. The Procter & Gamble Co., Case No. 11-cv-07238.\n\nIf you have ever been mislead by false advertising or inaccurate labeling, you may have a consumer claim.

5	Bally’s “Lifetime” Runaround	Former Bally Total Fitness “lifetime” members are giving the iconic fitness chain a real workout.  Earlier this week, a Federal Court in New Jersey denied in part Bally’s motion to dismiss claims relating to the transition of Bally lifetime memberships from Bally to LA Fitness in the mass sale of most Bally facilities in 2011.  In Piegaro v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp., Case No. 3:12-cv-04595, Plaintiffs allege that Bally failed to honor its lifetime membership contracts by closing most of its facilities and failing to properly transfer those contracts to LA Fitness.  LA Fitness acquired the majority of Bally’s assets, including most of its member contracts, in a 2011 assets sale between the two fitness giants.  In the wake of the sale, it became apparent that LA Fitness did not intend to honor Bally’s lifetime memberships, some of which date back to the 1980′s.  Lifetime members were allegedly told that their contracts were never included in the assets acquired by LA Fitness, and that those members should continue to use Bally facilities.  The problem was that Bally had closed or sold substantially all of its facilities.  The Court in Piegaro denied Bally’s motion to dismiss and will allow the Plaintiffs’ breach of contract and certain fraud claims to go forward.\n\nIf you were a Bally “lifetime” member and your contract was not honored after the sale to LA Fitness, you may be a member of the putative class.  If you’d like more information on the Bally Total Fitness Lifetime Membership class action, please feel free to contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

16	5-Hour Energy Ad Claim Questioned	Ever wonder what happens six hours after you drink a 5-Hour Energy drink?  Well, 5-Hour Energy has long advertised that you will experience “no crash later” after consuming the popular energy drink.  But recently the company’s claim has come under tough fire from watchdog groups and from consumers alike. 5-Hour Energy claims that the concentrated caffeine drink produces no crash, which is the type of letdown that consumers of energy drinks often feel when the beverages’ effects wear off. The NAD has recommended that 5-Hour Energy’s distributor, Living Essentials, discontinue the “no crash later” claims because Living Essentials’ own evidence has shown that there is a crash from the product.\n\nIf you have been mislead into buying 5-Hour Energy by the drink’s “no crash later” advertising, you may have a claim. If so, please contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC for more information.

9	Bad Buzz For Budweiser	Say it ain’t so! The King of Beers watering down its products?? According to four class action lawsuits filed this week across the Country, Anheuser-Busch waters down its beers “well below” their advertised 5% alcohol volume in order to boost profits. The plaintiffs in the suits allege intentional “mislabeling” of at least 10 beers’ alcohol content, after the brewer has added water to boost the amount of beer produced from raw materials. The suits allege that Anheuser-Busch violated consumer protection laws by “deliberately manipulating the brewing process and producing malt beverages knowing that their alcohol content is mislabeled.”   They further claim that Anheuser-Busch has the technology to precisely control the amount of alcohol in its beers but adds water so that the alcohol content is “significantly” below the advertised figure of 5% by volume and that, as a result, Anheuser-Busch is unjustly enriched by the additional volume it can sell.  The claims are based on information from former employees at various breweries operated by Anheuser-Busch. Anheuser-Busch has emphatically stated that the claims are “completely false.”  The allegedly mislabeled beer includes Budweiser, Bud Light Platinum, Michelob, Michelob Ultra, Natural Ice, and others.  The Plaintiffs are seeking over $5 million in damages and are asking the court to require the beer maker to fund a corrective advertising campaign.\n\nIf you have concerns about deceptively labeled products, foods or beverages, please contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC to discuss your issue.

8	LivingSocial Offers Daily-Deal On Your Personal Information!	As many as 50 million LivingSocial accounts were impacted in a decidedly unsocial data hack last week.  The hugely popular daily-deal website confirmed that its computer systems were hacked, resulting in “unauthorized access” to customer data stored on its servers.  LivingSocial has disclosed that names, e-mail addresses, some users’ dates of birth and salted passwords were accessed.  Salting is a security method where a sequence of symbols is added to passwords before they’re hashed.  LivingSocial has not confirmed how its systems were compromised, nor has it disclosed the true extent of the data breach.  Although LivingSocial maintains that no customer credit card information was accessed, it is certain that customers’ private  personal information was compromised.  LivingSocial joins a long line of companies that were hacked recently, including LinkedIn, Yahoo, eHarmony, Formspring and Billabong.\n\nAs with any data breach, if you are a LivingSocial customer, we recommend that you immediately change your passwords on other on-line accounts, be extra vigilant when it comes to spam e-mail and purchase a credit monitoring package that will alert you to any identity theft attempts.  If you were a victim of the LivingSocial data breach or any other personal data hack, please contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC for more information.

17	Skechers “Toning Shoes” Class Action Sprints Forward	The Skechers U.S.A. “Toning Shoes” lawsuit is moving forward in Federal Court in Kentucky.  Last year, in a seemingly unending marathon of bad publicity and consumer complaints, Skechers agreed to pay a $40 million fine in connection with charges that the company tricked consumers by making claims that its toning shoes would help people lose weight, and strengthen and tone their buttocks, legs and stomach muscles.\n\nAlthough many people may have received a benefit from last year’s settlement, a consumer class action pending in Federal Court in Kentucky will likely provide additional redress to those who may have been injured by Skechers’ products.  The case, which is part of National MDL, includes allegations that Skechers’ toning shoes change a person’s walking gait which can lead to stress fracture, joint injuries, and tendon and ligament injuries.  Skechers’ toning shoes include the following models: Shape-ups, Resistance Runner, Toners, and Tone-ups.\n\nIf you’d like more information about the Skechers “Toning Shoes” class action, or if you’ve been injured by a consumer product, please contact the attorneys at DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

15	Aveeno’s “Natural Oat Formula” Might Not Be So “Natural”	Johnson & Johnson was hit with a class action suit relating to the advertising and marketing of its Aveeno Baby products, including Aveeno Baby Wash and Aveeno Baby Calming Comfort Bath.  The suit alleges that the phrase “Natural Oat Formula” displayed on the bottles is false and misleading to consumers because the products contain a host of synthetic chemicals.\n\nThe case, filed last week in Federal Court in New Jersey and captioned as Virgil et al. v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Cos. Inc., Case No. 13-cv-00524, claims that the advertising leads customers to believe that the product formulas are entirely comprised of natural ingredients.  Plaintiffs also allege that, not only are the Aveeno baby wash products not “natural,” they also contain ingredients that can be carcinogenic to humans. “Incredibly, Aveeno Calming Comfort Bath’s purportedly Natural Formula contains Quaternium 15, a preservative that works by slowly releasing formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen used for embalming and as a disinfectant,” the complaint states. “Defendant’s false and misleading representations are particularly egregious because the Products are marketed for use on babies.”  Plaintiffs allege that the Aveeno baby wash products also contain glycol distearate, a skin conditioning agent, and PEG 15 distearate, which is used as a surfactant. “Instead of receiving a natural formula product, the plaintiffs and the class received products in direct contradiction the defendant’s representations, which contained unnatural, synthetic ingredients.”  The Aveeno consumer fraud class action lawsuit is brought on behalf of all consumers who purchased Aveeno Baby Wash and Aveeno Baby Calming Comfort Bath in the United States.\n\nIf you’d like more information on the Aveeno case or if you’ve been mislead by other “all-natural” advertising claims, please feel free to contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

12	YoPlus Settlement Gives General Mills A Tummyache	General Mills has agreed to swallow $8.5 million to settle a class action lawsuit alleging that the company falsely advertised the digestive health benefits of its YoPlus probiotic yogurt.  The case, venued in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and captioned as Jeremiah Johnson v. General Mills Inc. et al., Case No. 10-cv-00061, alleges that consumers were deceived into paying more for YoPlus by misleading claims that YoPlus provides certain additional digestive health benefits not found in other yogurt products. Under the YoPlus class action settlement, consumers will be entitled to $4 for each unit of YoPlus they purchased.  Any unclaimed funds from the $8.5 million settlement will be distributed to the good folks at the National Consumer Law Center and to the Mayo Clinic, which will support the Mayo Clinic’s nationwide public education efforts concerning nutrition and gastrointestinal health.\n\nIf you’d like more information about the YoPlus Probiotic Yogurt Class Action Lawsuit, or if you feel as though you’ve been mislead by false labeling or advertising on a food product, please contact the lawyers at DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

6	Nope, Frosted Mini-Wheats Don’t Make Kids Smarter . . .	A Federal Court recently granted preliminary approval of a $4 Million settlement in the Kellogg’s Frosted Mini-Wheats class action.  If you purchased Frosted Mini-Wheats in the United States between 2008 and 2009, you may be eligible to receive up to $15 cash from the settlement.  The Mini-Wheats settlement will resolve a four-year-old class action lawsuit pending in Federal Court in the Southern District of California called Dennis v. Kellogg Co., Case No. 9-cv-01786.  The case centers around Plaintiff’s allegation that Kellogg falsely advertised the benefits of eating the popular Frosted Mini-Wheats breakfast cereal.  Specifically, Kellogg’s ads claimed that Mini-Wheats improved kids’ attentiveness, memory and other cognitive functions.  Plaintiff argued that Kellogg’s ads were exaggerated to a degree not supported by competent clinical evidence.  Kellogg stands by its advertising and denies any wrongdoing but has agreed to this partial refund settlement in order to resolve the litigation.\n\nYou are a class member if you purchased Kellogg’s Frosted Mini-Wheats in the United States between January 28, 2008 and October 1, 2009.    Class members may seek reimbursement of $5 per box of cereal purchased, up to a maximum of three boxes ($15).\n\nIf you’d like more information about the Frosted Mini-Wheats settlement, or if you’ve been mislead by false or exaggerated advertising claims made in relation to food products, please feel free to contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

1	Happy Hour at Bottle King!	New Jersey shoppers are getting a round on the house this month thanks to a FACTA settlement in a class action against liquor retailer Bottle King.  A State Court Judge in New Jersey granted preliminary approval of a class action settlement in Nelson v. Ledgewood B.K., Inc. / Bottle King, Docket No. MRS-L-2426-12 paving the way for twenty percent discount coupons for all eligible class members.\n\nThe claims in the Bottle King case involve Bottle King’s company-wide practice of printing personal credit and debit card receipts containing card expiration dates.  Under both Federal and New Jersey law, retailers are prohibited from printing sales receipts that contain a consumer’s card expiration date or certain other uniquely identifying elements.  Bottle King ceased the practice after suit was filed in late 2012, but the practice was ongoing since at least April 2008.  The class action was the first of its kind filed in New Jersey under the State’s Fair Credit Reporting Act, which is a corollary to FACTA, the Federal statute.  The claims were brought under the Truth-in-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act (TCCWNA), which was triggered by the underlying expiration date violation.\n\nThe Bottle King claim period is open now, and claim forms can be obtained through the settlement website, www.bottlekingsettlement.com.  If you’re interested in the Bottle King case, or if you’ve ever received a receipt that violates FACTA, please feel free to contact DiSabato & Bouckenooghe LLC.

5	\nWe're pursuing a class action on behalf of Enterprise Rent-A-Car customers in New Jersey who may have been double-billed for toll charges.  Our client alleges that he paid a toll using his EZ-Pass tag, but was then billed for the same toll (plus an administrative fee) by Enterprise. If you'd like to learn more about the case, please feel free to contact us.	\N	\N	\N	Enterprise	https://disabatolaw.com/images/31f25c5e60a547e86e6b55c55e5949bf_w2t1.png
7	We just concluded our third successful victory this year for New Jersey homeowners against home improvement contractors.  New Jersey has a very protective public policy when it comes to home improvement work.  Although most contractors follow the law, many do not.  We know the Consumer Fraud Act and the Home Improvement Practice Regulations better than any contractor doing business today.  In our three recent wins, we leveraged that knowledge and an aggressive litigation strategy to recover substantial damages for our clients.  Homeowners should never be at the mercy of their contractors.  If you are having problems with your home improvement contractor, please feel free to call us for help.  \n	\N	\N	\N	New Jersey Contractors	https://disabatolaw.com/images/92de3316ecaeb4d381429ca978d4874b_6z1u_gkj6.png
4	We're spearheading an expansive class action against Payless Car Rental (Avis Budget Group) focusing on the discount rental company's alleged practice of surreptitiously adding extra products to customers' contracts.  Customers have reported being billed for items such as fuel charges, loss damage waiver and roadside assistance charges that they explicitly declined at the rental desk.  The case has picked up momentum in the media, including several mentions in The New York Times.  This is one to keep an eye on, and if you've had bad experiences with Payless, please let us know.	\N	\N	\N	Payless Car Rental	https://disabatolaw.com/images/0abfe885ce26e6d6b976184c0fad49a5_h3ds.png
1	We recently won a unique summary judgment victory against notorious check-buyer plaintiff Robert Triffin.  Triffin is in the business of buying dishonored checks and seeking to enforce holder-in-due-course rights against the checks' drawers.  Triffin has successfully prosecuted over 20,000 of these cases in New Jersey, and we suspect his business is booming since the advent of mobile deposit technology.  Although the Court could have granted summary judgment under N.J.S.A. 12A:3-414(c) (discharge through prior acceptance), or based on Triffin's defective assignment, the Court instead found that the check in question bore the indicia of a prior mobile deposit, making it so "irregular" as to destroy Triffin's holder status pursuant to N.J.S.A. 12A:3-302(a)(1).  This case (Triffin v. LogistiCare Solutions, LLC, ATL-DC-4118-16) represents the first time the UCC has been applied to mobile deposits in this context.	https://disabatolaw.com/uploads/Triffin_Order.pdf	\N	\N	Checks Cashed	https://disabatolaw.com/images/86ff446793d32c2b0a2bcb298596130f_xh08.png
10	Preliminary approval of our class action settlement in our Bottle King case was granted last week.  In the action, we allege that certain Bottle King credit and debit card receipts included card expiration dates in violation of New Jersey's FACTA corollary. This is the first case of its kind brought in New Jersey.  The groundbreaking settlement will provide discount coupons to all class members who submit timely claims.  The claim period runs through July 7, 2014.  To view the settlement details and obtain a claim form, click here.

9	\nWe scored another big win for homeowners in the endless war over whether borrowers can enforce their Trial Payment Plans against the lender.  In this class action against Bank of America, the District Court for the District of New Jersey denied BofA's motion to dismiss and has allowed our client's claims for breach of contract and violations of New Jersey's Consumer Fraud Act to move forward.  The decision, Laughlin v. Bank of America, N.A., 2014 WL 2602260 (D.N.J.), adds to the growing body of Federal cases that are coming down against the banks on this issue.  If you'd like to know more about the case, or if you completed a Trial Payment Plan but were denied a permanent modification, please feel free to contact us.	https://disabatolaw.com/uploads/Laughlin_v._Bank_of_America__N.A..pdf	\N	\N	Bank of America	https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/3/35/Bank_of_America_2.svg/revision/latest?cb=20100709064402
13	\nWe achieved a significant step forward in our Bally Total Fitness "Lifetime" Memberships class action on June 12, 2013 when the Court denied Bally's motion to dismiss and allowed plaintiff's breach of contract and certain fraud claims to proceed.  This was a step in the right direction for long-suffering Bally members whose lifetime contracts were effectively terminated in 2011 when Bally sold most of its assets to rival fitness chain, LA Fitness.  If you'd like to hear more about the case, or if you were a Bally lifetime member, please contact us.	\N	\N	\N	Bally Total Fitness	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/Bally_Total_Fitness_logo.gif/220px-Bally_Total_Fitness_logo.gif
2	\nWe are currently investigating claims against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., relating to Chase's assessment of insufficient funds fees, also known as overdraft fees.  It appears that Chase may deliberately schedule e-mail and text overdraft notifications to arrive one day after the overdraft occurs.  Chase charges a daily fee of $34 per overdraft and, by delaying customers' notifications, Chase may deprive customers of the opportunity to avoid the hefty fee. If this has happened to you, please contact us so we can discuss your situation and assess your claims.	\N	\N	\N	Chase	https://disabatolaw.com/images/b883cf6c4dede23b551da279ec410ca9_sjgf.png
3	We just took on the Atlantic City taxicab industry on behalf of the United Drivers for Uber South Jersey.  Our class action alleges that the cab companies have violated civil RICO and engaged in various forms of unfair competition to the detriment of our clients. We believe that this case has significant impact on the public safety of Uber riders in the Atlantic City area, as the cabs' insurance may not provide coverage under these circumstances. This case puts us on the front line of the tumultuous New Jersey rideshare wars.	\N	\N	\N	Uber	https://disabatolaw.com/images/b8ed4689a2f1e0c0a072f8971470fae1_8ve3.png
6	We won a nice victory in our timeshare sales practices class action against FantaSea Resorts by defeating defendants' motion to dismiss.  Our claims center on defendants' practice of requiring purchasers to execute a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure at the time they close on the purchase of their timeshare interest.  We allege that this practice is illegal under New Jersey law because it deprives owners of certain rights of redemption they would otherwise have. The decision, Tirri v. Flagship Resort Development Corp., 2016 WL 6123146 (D.N.J.), concludes that we've stated a claim under the CFA, TCCWNA and the FAA.  If you've had problems with your Flagship timeshare, please feel free to reach out to us.	\N	\N	\N	fantaSea Resorts	https://www.fantasearesorts.com/e-camp/owner_gift_html/owner_gift_logo.png

We are specifically focusing our investigation on Ethicon's Proceed surgical mesh, which was used in both men and women.  We encourage anyone to contact us who believes he or she may have cause to bring claims against Ethicon for injuries resulting from Ethicon's Proceed mesh.  At present, there are only a handful of pending cases related to Proceed hernia mesh.  We will give your situation the personal and individual attention you deserve.	\N	\N	\N	Ethicon	https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/ethicon.svg
12	We recently filed a class action against The Tempelton Group LLC of Westbury, New York, in connection with Tempelton's loan modification scam.  In the Complaint, we allege that Tempelton illegally charged up-front fees to unsuspecting homeowners in return for false promises of negotiated mortgage modifications. Thousands of homeowners were victimized by Tempelton, and Tempelton is the subject of an investigation by the Nassau County District Attorney's Office.  If you were among Tempelton's victims, please contact us to become part of the class action.	\N	\N	\N	The Tempelton Group	http://www.templetongroupllc.com/images/templeton_logo.gif
14	Our Toyota unintended acceleration class action - which was consolidated in the California MDL - was part of the historic settlement recently reached with Toyota.

11	We started 2014 with a tremendous win for New Jersey homeowners in our ongoing class action against infamous mortgage servicer, Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc.  The Court denied Saxon's omnibus motion to dismiss in its entirety and will allow our claims for breach of Trial Payment Plan contracts, fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of New Jersey's Consumer Fraud Act all to move ahead.  When discussing Saxon's conduct, the Court observed that Saxon used Trial Payment Plans to "set the hook" in struggling homeowners.  If you'd like to learn more about the case, or if you have a servicing grievance against Saxon, we'd love to hear from you.	\N	\N	\N	Saxon	https://11284-presscdn-0-40-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/saxon.jpg
